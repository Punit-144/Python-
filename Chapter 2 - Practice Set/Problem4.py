# Use Comparision operator to find out whether a given variable 'a' is greater tha 'b' or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

a = int(input("Enter a : "))
b = int(input("Enter b : ")) 
c = a > b
print("Is a greater than b or not : ", c)

# Question Specifically asked for fixed a and b values but i improvised to get input from users using typeconversion.
