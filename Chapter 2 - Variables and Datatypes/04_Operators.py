# Airthemetic Operators: 
a= 34
b = 45
c = a + b
print(c)

# Assignment Operators:
a = 4-2 # Assign 4-2 in a 
print(a)
b=6
b += 3 # Increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b)
c=9
c -= 3 # Dcrement the value of c by 3 and then assign it to c
print(c)

# Comparision Operators:
d = 5<4
print(d) # Output will be Falso (Always Boolean)

# Logical Operators:
e = 1 or 5
print(e)
